"""Network centrality metrics for network psychometric models.

All functions accept a symmetric adjacency (edge-weight) matrix and return
a score per node (item). These are the standard centrality measures used
in the network psychometrics literature (Opsahl et al., 2010;
Epskamp & Fried, 2018).

Functions
---------
strength_centrality
    Sum of absolute edge weights — most common measure in psychometrics.
expected_influence
    Signed sum of edge weights — sensitive to edge polarity.
closeness_centrality
    Reciprocal of mean shortest-path distance in the weighted graph.
betweenness_centrality
    Fraction of shortest paths passing through each node.

    The most widely used centrality measure in network psychometrics.
    A high-strength node has strong connections (in absolute value) with
    many other nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjacency : torch.Tensor
        Symmetric edge-weight matrix (n_items, n_items), zero diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Strength per node, shape (n_items,).

    Unlike strength, this is sensitive to the *polarity* of edges and can
    be negative for nodes connected primarily by negative edges. Proposed
    by Robinaugh et al. (2016) for signed networks (e.g., symptom networks).

    Parameters
    ----------
